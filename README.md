# This is a BLOG -UI Project

## The Project description is as below mentioned.

Here i have created three links:
* Home
* Users
* Posts

As we click on the users link it takes me to the use page, where we get a list of 10 users. Those users data is fetched from external API calls. As one clicks on the user name which lands him to the posts written bt that user

Similarly, When we click on the Posts link we get landed to the Posts page whare we get 100 posts of all the 10 users. If someone clicks on a post it is going to take him to a new page which dispays the post written by that user, body and the comments.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

```
bash
npm install react-router-dom
npm install redux
npm install react-redux
npm install redux thunk
npm install axios
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
